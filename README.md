# MFPointNet_feature_dataset
To address the lack of sufficient dataset for using neural networks to recognize the machining features, we established a novel machining feature dataset called MFDataset. The MFDataset contains 33 subcategories features, with approximately 2000 features per category. The detailed category of dataset is shown in Fig.1 below.

The MFDataset includes in detail:
Slots: T-through slot, V-through slot, Rounded groove, Swallowtail groove, A-keyway, B-keyway, C-keyway, Half-moon keyway, Straight groove, Ring-shaped groove (10 types)
Holes: Round through hole, Round blind hole, Cylindrical countersunk hole, Tapered countersunk hole, Round stepped hole, A-center hole (6 types)
Steps: Rectangular through step, General step, Shaft step (3 types)
Threads: Internal screw thread, External screw thread (2 types)
Transitions: Rounding, Chamfer, Round (3 types)
Protrudes: Convex hull, Boss (2 types)
Bases: Plane, External cylindrical surface (2 types)
Others: Opened pocket, Closed pocket, Triangular rib reinforcement, General removal of volume, Spherical crown (5 types)
